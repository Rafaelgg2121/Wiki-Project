follow the next steps:
using postman:
Import the environment “New environment”
Then import the three collections
Once you have the collections under the ‘New environment on postman’ go to monitors
And create monitors for the three collections: order, user pets, under the env ‘New environment’
Set the monitors to hourly, set the email where you want to receive results and you’re done. You have theses APIs automated and will received emails when one of them fails.
